 👋 Hey. I'm currently studying software development at British Columbia Technology Institute.

## About Me:
- 🧮 Right now I'm part of a team working on building out a classifieds app that will allow a user to create an account and upload something to sell using Full Stack Javascript which will be hosted on Amazon Web Services using a Dynamo database.
- 🎋 Recently, I've devoted most of my time to learning the fundamentals of React as a framework, while taking time to tweak my personal portfolio.
- 🇯🇵 One day I'd like to build my own language translation app with a few special features ;)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been to Japan twice and it has always felt like a second home to me. 

## Want to talk?
